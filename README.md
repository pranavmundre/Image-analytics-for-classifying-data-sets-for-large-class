# Image analytics for classifying datasets for large class

    The aim of this work is to discuss a selection of the most popular image analysis techniques in the context of industrial inspection applications. We will explain the mechanics of each method and demonstrate their applicability (or lack of such applicability) in the industrial setting using real industrial images. The facial expression recognition system presented in this research work contributes a resilient face recognition model based on the mapping of behavioral characteristics with the physiological biometric characteristics. The physiological characteristics of the human face with relevance to various expressions such as happiness, sadness, fear, anger, surprise and disgust are associated with geometrical structures which restored as base matching template for the recognition system.

    Various types of moments have been used to recognize image patterns in a number of applications. The author evaluates a number of moments and addresses some fundamental questions, such as image representation ability, noise sensitivity, and information redundancy. Moments considered include regular moments, Legendre moments, Zernike moments, pseudo-Zernike moments, rotational moments and complex moments. Properties of these moments are examined in detail, and the interrelationships among them are discussed. Both theoretical and experimental results are presented.
